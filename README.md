Other consistently high-performing products include Spaghetti & Meatballs, Tofu Pad Thai, Cheeseburger, and French Fries.

## Sales & Order Trends
The heatmap analysis of daily orders shows that the busiest hours fall between 12 PM and 7 PM, with peak hours varying slightly across the week.
The highest order activity occurs on Thursday and Friday evenings, making these the most profitable days for the restaurant.

## Profitability Analysis (Missing Data)
The dataset does not include profit margins per product, which limits a full profitability analysis. While total sales provide an overview, understanding individual product profitability requires cost data to assess margins and net earnings.

## Conclusions & Recommendations
1. Focus on best-selling items: Increasing stock and marketing for top-performing products (e.g., Korean Beef Bowl, Spaghetti & Meatballs) can drive further sales.
2. Reevaluate underperforming items: Consider promotions, recipe changes, or removal of low-performing products to optimize menu profitability.
3. Capitalize on peak hours: Given the high demand on Thursday and Friday evenings, targeted discounts, combo deals, or special promotions during these periods could maximize revenue.
4. Further analysis on profitability: Collecting cost data per item can provide a clearer picture of the most profitable products beyond just revenue numbers.
